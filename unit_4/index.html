				<p>I have always enjoyed art. In grade school I began my obsession over textures, colors and shapes. Teachers were supportive and encouraged me until it was engraved in me to fully see there was something beyond my hobby. As I grew older art became my muse, something only I understood among family and friends, but this creativity never left the privacy of my notebook. ...More soon.
